## Welcome
WhatLanguage, a simple website that shows you what programming languages were used to make your favorite Github projects.

## How does it work?
WhatLanguage uses [Githubs API](http://developer.github.com) to display the language breakdown for whatever repo url you enter in the space above.


## Tech
WhatLanguage is built on [BackboneJS](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/), [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org), and [HandlebarsJS](http://handlebarsjs.com/).

WhatLanguage also uses the totally awesome [ShowdownJS](http://softwaremaniacs.org/playground/showdown-highlight/) to render this page from its own `README.md` file!

To make all the magic happen WhatLanguage also uses the [JasonHub](http://github.com/codeimpossible/jasonhub), the open-source Github API library for RequireJS.
